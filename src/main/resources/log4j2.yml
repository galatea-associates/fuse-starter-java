      # during Spring Boot initialization which usually happen about a second apart which create
      # new log files since the log file name below is formatted with seconds (HHmmss). We COULD
      # mask this by removing seconds from this config, but it would still create multiple files if
      # the JVM was started right as the minute changes. Not a big deal so we're leaving it for now.
